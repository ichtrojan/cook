## Usage

Create `.env` from template 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate `.env` with appropriate values and run the server

```bash
go run server.go
```

Cook would be available on port `6666`

## Why does this exist?

I build a lot of random projectsâ€”most of them never make it past localhost. Eventually, I felt the need to pull out the commonly used pieces and turn them into a more structured template.

This setup probably wonâ€™t work for everyoneâ€”or maybe even most people writing Goâ€”but Iâ€™m putting it out there anyway. Itâ€™s mainly for my own sanity, to help me spin up new projects faster.

## Who should use this?

- Lazy people 
- Non-vibe coders

## Time for some devsplaining

I would use this section to explain some not so obvious items.

### Go Validator

You can find more details in the original documentation on the packageâ€™s GitHub page. That said, Iâ€™ve added a few custom validation rules of my own:

- `array`: checks that the JSON attribute is a valid array
- `base64`: checks that itâ€™s a valid base64-encoded string
- `uuid_array`: checks that itâ€™s an array of valid UUIDs
- `array_unique_uuid`: checks that itâ€™s an array of unique UUIDs
- `valid_future_timestamp`: checks that itâ€™s a valid timestamp in the future

### Why do we have a laravel project in the `misc` folder?

Very good question. In my (not-so-long) stint writing Go, I havenâ€™t found a migration library I actually like. Iâ€™ve tried a bunchâ€”most of them expect you to write raw SQL like a caveman. Thing is, I came to Go after years of being pampered by Laravel's migration system.

So, in the misc folder, youâ€™ll find a super stripped-down Laravel project whose only job is to manage migrations. Itâ€™s totally optionalâ€”you can delete it and use whatever tool you're more comfortable with. It's not critical to running the template at all.

### Asynq/Asynqmon

Asynq is available by default when you run the server. However, the Asynqmon monitoring dashboard isnâ€™t enabled out of the box. To turn it on, set the `ASYNQMON_SERVICE` key to true in your .env file. After that, restart the server, and Asynqmon will be available at port `6660`.

## Closing remarks

This README was written while listening to LOCKED IN by Maison2500 ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/locked-in/1780407404?i=1780407718), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/16mBGLL2q29af8swK1pnRW?si=0f28c04348a040bd)) not like it matters. There are a bunch of things I don't have the time to explain but I'm sure you'd figure out as you attempt to use this template.
